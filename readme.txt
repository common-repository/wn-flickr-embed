== Description ==

WN Flickr Image Downloader is very useful plugin that is going to help you to save a lot of time. If you use Flicker Images often, then you probably feels sometimes tired by the process of downloading the properly image, then finding out the title, author name, author link, license type, license link and finally inserting all this information wherever you have placed this image on your site. Well this plugin does all that work with your by just pressing "one" button. Once you have entered the url of the images that you want to process, just click on the Fetch Photos and the plugin is going to fetch all the images, it will also skip automatically those which are "All rights reserved" and notify you through a log all the proccess.
Once the images has been sucessfully fetched you can either save them into the media library with or save them into the media library AND create a post automatically where where all these images would be inserted and a reference to the image name, image link, author name, author link, license name and license link would be also inserted. In case you decide to do not create the post automatically then you can copy the html code genereted and insert it in any page post or product of your site to show all this information (image + reference).
